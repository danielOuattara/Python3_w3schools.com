Python Getting Started
=======================

Python Install
================
Many PCs and Macs will have python already installed.

To check if you have python installed on a Windows PC, search in 
the start bar for Python or run the following on the Command Line 
(cmd.exe)[Windows], in Terminal [Mac , Linux] 
________________
python --version

If you find that you do not have python installed on your computer, 
then you can download it for free from the following website: 
https://www.python.org/


Python Quickstart
=====================
Python is an interpreted programming language, this means that as 
a developer you write Python files (.py) in a text editor and then 
put those files into the python interpreter to be executed.

The way to run a python file is like this on the command line:
____________________
python helloworld.py ,  "helloworld.py" is the name of your python file.

Let's write our first Python file, called helloworld.py, which can 
be done in any text editor.

"helloworld.py"

print("Hello, World!")

Simple as that. Save your file. Open your command line, navigate to 
the directory where you saved your file, and run:

_____________________
python helloworld.py

The output should read:

Hello, World!

Congratulations, you have written and executed your first Python 
program.

The Python Command Line

To test a short amount of code in python sometimes it is quickest and easiest not
to write the code in a file. This is made possible because Python can be run as a
command line itself.

Type the following on the Windows, Mac or Linux command line:
'''
#____________________________
#> python
#____________________________

'''
Or, if the "python" command did not work, you can try "py":
'''
#_______________________
#> py
#_______________________

'''
From there you can write any python, including our hello world example from earlier
in the tutorial:


Which will write "Hello, World!" in the command line:
'''
#___________________________
#> python
#___________________________

'''
Python 3.6.4 (v3.6.4:d48eceb, Dec 19 2017, 06:04:45) [MSC v.1900 32 bit (Intel)] on win32
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.

>>> print("Hello, World!")

Hello, World!

Whenever you are done in the python command line, you can simply type the following to quit
the python command line interface:
________
exit()
