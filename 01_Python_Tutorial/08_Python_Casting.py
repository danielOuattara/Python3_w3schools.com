""" Python Casting
==================
Python is an object-orientated language, and as such
it uses classes to define data types, including its
primitive types.

Casting in Python is therefore done using constructor
functions:
"""

x = int(1)  # x will be 1
y = int(2.8)  # y will be 2
z = int("3")  # z will be 3

x = float(1)  # x will be 1.0
y = float(2.8)  # y will be 2.8
z = float("3")  # z will be 3.0
w = float("4.2")  # w will be 4.2

x = str("s1")  # x will be 's1'
y = str(2)  # y will be '2'
z = str(3.0)  # z will be '3.0'
