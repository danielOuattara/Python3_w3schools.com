What is Python ?
==================

Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, 
and released in 1991.


It is used for:
================
   > web development (server-side),
   > software development,
   > mathematics,
   > system scripting.


What can Python do ?
====================
    Python can be used :
       >  on a server to create web applications.
       >  alongside software to create workflows.
       >  to connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.
       >  to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.
       >  for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.

Why Python ?
============
   > Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi,...)
   > Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.
   > Python syntax allows developers to write programs with fewer lines.
   > Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed 
     as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.
   > Python can be treated in a procedural way, object-orientated way or 
     a functional way.

Good to know
===============
    The most recent major version of Python is Python 3, which we shall be 
    using in this tutorial. However, Python 2, although not being updated 
    with anything other than security updates, is still quite popular.
    
    In this tutorial Python will be written in a text editor. It is possible 
    to write Python in an Integrated Development Environment, such as Thonny, 
    Pycharm, Netbeans or Eclipse which are particularly useful when managing 
    larger collections of Python files.

Python Syntax compared to other programming languages
=======================================================
    Python was designed for readability, and has some similarities to the 
    English language with influence from mathematics.
    
    Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming 
    languages which often use semicolons or parentheses.
    
    Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as 
    the scope of loops, functions and classes. Other programming languages often 
    use curly-brackets for this purpose.
